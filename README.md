# Billiards

This project implements a browser-based billiards game. Currently the game supports only two modes:

- **Snooker** — full snooker rules and table layout.
- **Eight Ball** — standard 8-ball rules (solids/stripes, black 8-ball).

**Quick Start**

- **Client:**

	1. Open a terminal and run:

		 ```bash
		 cd Client
		 npm install
		 npm run dev
		 ```

- **Server:**

	1. In a separate terminal run:

		 ```bash
		 cd Server
		 npm install
		 npm run dev
		 ```

Open the Client app in your browser (Vite will print the local URL).

**Notes & Limitations**

- The repository currently only implements Snooker and Eight Ball modes.
- Other billiards variants are not implemented.
- See the `Client/src` and `Server/src` folders for implementation details.
